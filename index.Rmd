##Data Description & Processing Steps


###Problem 1

**A flexdashboard created using plotly is here[].**

####In this project, we are interested in the “The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017” dataset which contains over 3 million online grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users. Since this dataset is quite extensive, we only focus on order status in the following 4 departments: deli, frozen, produce and bakery. 

- In **Figure A**, we analyzed the total number of orders in each department and presented the most popular products in each department. 

- In **Figure B**, we analyzed the hour of the day on which the order was placed in each department. From the box plot, we observed that the medians across the 4 departments are all within 10-15 hours during the day. 

- In **Figure C**, we further analyzed the nubmer of orders placed in each department during the week. We obeserve that the number of orders for the 4 departments remain a consistant pattern regardless of the day of the week. 

We will take a closer look for variables within each department using shiny.
